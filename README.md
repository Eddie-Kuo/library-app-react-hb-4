<!-- ## Plan 
- BrowserRouter goes inside index.js with the App component nested inside
- Within the div on App.js - that is where the switch goes and each route will point to a new component if navigating from App.js - home screen?
  - all the routes will be set within App.js + the keys of the URL 
  path = '/books/:id' component = { }
  - for this assignment, app.js will have 1 link to take user to the list of books 
    - from the books, each book will have their own <link> in order to take the user to the details about the book 
    - within the map function for listing out the books, thats where the link will go in order to redirect the user to the correct page 

- home page + 404 error page  -->
<!-- BookList componenet is the list of books -->
